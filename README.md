# Advanced Application of JavaScript: Dynamic To-Do List

Welcome to my **Advanced Application of JavaScript** project! In this project, I build a dynamic To-Do List application that lets users add, display, and remove tasks.

## Project Objectives

- **DOM Manipulation:** I select and modify DOM elements using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling:** I attach event listeners to manage user interactions.
- **Data Persistence:** I use `localStorage` to save tasks, ensuring data remains after closing the browser.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I:

- Demonstrate advanced JavaScript skills.
- Create interactive and dynamic web applications.
- Understand how to persist user data in the browser.

## Clone Repository

Happy coding!
